# CG2111A “Alex to the Rescue”
Following a catastrophic explosion at Moonbase CEG in the Sea of Tranquillity, a critical search and rescue operation is required within a simulated lunar base environment. The terrain is fraught with obstacles, including walls, barriers at least 21 cm in height, and restricted zones, forming multiple rooms that pose significant navigational challenges. Scattered across this hazardous landscape are astronaut figures, classified by colour: green astronauts require the delivery of a medpak, while red astronauts must be dragged to a designated safe zone. Objects of other colours are not astronauts and must be ignored.

The tele-operated robotic vehicle, Alex, controlled via a laptop-based Ground Control Station (GCS), is tasked with navigating this complex environment to execute a time-critical rescue mission within an 8-minute time limit. Alex’s primary objective is to efficiently move from the starting location to the end zone while avoiding collisions with obstacles and astronauts. To aid navigation, Alex will generate a real-time LiDAR-based map of the environment, relaying this data to the teleoperator for informed decision-making. Additionally, Alex must leverage a colour sensor to identify astronauts and a robotic arm to perform the respective rescue tasks, such as delivering medpaks to green astronauts and relocating red astronauts to safety.

The mission demands robust obstacle avoidance, precise victim identification, and smooth execution of rescue operations, reflecting the real-world complexities of time-sensitive search and rescue in unpredictable, high-risk lunar settings. Alex must balance speed, accuracy, and safety to maximize mission success within the stringent time constraint.
